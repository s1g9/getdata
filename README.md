Step 1) Download the script run_analysis.R to your working directory.

Step 2) Change the path variable on the top of the script according to your path from working directory to UCI HAR DATASET folder (Samsung data)

And now you are good to go !

RUN: Run the script run_analysis.R 
RESULTS: Find the file, named "Results.txt", created inside UCI HAR DATASET folder to see the results.
Also you can use the command "tbl_df(read.table(paste(path,"Results.txt",sep="/"),header=TRUE))"
after running the script to print the results in the console.


Thank you :)
